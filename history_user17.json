This means that any force exerted onto a second object will be accompanied by a force of equal magnitude but opposite direction exerted back onto the first object. In simpler terms, if you push something, it pushes back on you with the same amount of force.\n\nFor example, when you walk, your foot pushes backward against the ground, and the ground pushes forward on your foot, allowing you to move. Another common example is a rocket: the rocket pushes exhaust gases backward, and the gases push the rocket forward.\n\nThis law is fundamental in understanding how forces interact in the physical world."}, {"role": "user", "content": "PDF Task: Summarize"}, {"role": "user", "content": "PDF Task: Summarize"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " Here is a concise summary of the text:\n\n**Summary of \"Girl Meets Boy\" by Derek Strange**\n\nDonna, a young girl, meets Mark, a shy and good-looking boy, on a boat trip to Spain with her family.
